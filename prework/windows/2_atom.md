### Install Atom

Now it's time to install Atom, a sophisticated text editor for code, markup, and prose.

To get started, download <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> and run the installer. Go with the default installation options, unless you really know you want to change something.

Once installed, you can use the Start Menu to launch Atom.
