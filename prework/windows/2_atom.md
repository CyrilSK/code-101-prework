### Install Atom

Now it's time to install Atom, a sophisticated text editor for code, markup, and prose.

To get started, download [Atom](https://atom.io/) and run the installer. Again, go with the default installation options, unless you really know you want to change something.

Once installed, you can use the Start Menu to launch Atom.
