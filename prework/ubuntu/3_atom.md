### Install Atom

1. Download the `atom-amd64.deb` package from the <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest" target="_blank">Atom releases page</a>.
2. Open your Terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the package, and run `sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb`.
3. Launch Atom using the installed `atom` command.

The Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to
repeat these steps to upgrade to future releases.
