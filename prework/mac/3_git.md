### Install Git

Now go [here](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) to install Git, the version control system of choice among choosy developers. :neckbeard:

Once it is fully installed, open Terminal and run the following command.

```
git --version
```

And you'll see something like this.

### Git Config

Like artists, programmers sign their work. Let's configure Git to sign your commits with your name and email address. Make sure you sign up for an account at Github [here](https://github.com).

**WARNING:** Before running the following commands, replace `YOUR FULL NAME` and `YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS` with the name and email from [your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/profile).

```
git config --global user.name 'YOUR FULL NAME'
git config --global user.email 'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'
```

Next, run this command to download and install some awesome colors and handy aliases for Git.


### GitHub

You're on the home stretch now! :racehorse:

Run the following command to download and install some extra Git config that'll make your life easier when using GitHub from the command line.


```
curl -fsSL http://git.io/QxUaOQ | sh
```

### Congratulations!

Time for a frosty beverage. :beers:
