### Install Git

Now go [here](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) to install Git, the version control system of choice among choosy developers. :neckbeard:

Once it is fully installed, open Terminal and run the following command.

```
git --version
```

And you'll see something like this.

### Git Config

You're on the home stretch now! :racehorse:

Like artists, programmers sign their work. Let's configure Git to sign your commits with your name and email address. 

Sign up for an account at Github [here](https://github.com).

**WARNING:** Before running the following commands, replace `YOUR FULL NAME` and `YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS` with the name and email from [your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/profile).

```
git config --global user.name 'YOUR FULL NAME'
git config --global user.email 'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'
```

### Congratulations!

Time for a frosty beverage. :beers:
